### 3. Thermodynamic Model

**Mathematical Foundation**: First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics
```
dU/dt = Q_in - Q_out - W_out  (First Law)
dS/dt = Q_in/T_hot - Q_out/T_cold + S_gen  (Second Law)
```
Where:
- `U` is internal energy
- `S` is entropy
- `Q` is heat transfer
- `W` is work

- Efficiency ‚â§ Carnot efficiency: Œ∑ ‚â§ 1 - T_cold/T_hot
- Entropy increase: dS/dt ‚â• 0

### 4. Control System Theory

**Mathematical Foundation**: PID Control
```
u(t) = K_p*e(t) + K_i*‚à´e(œÑ)dœÑ + K_d*de(t)/dt
```
Where:
- `u(t)` is control input
- `e(t)` is error signal
- `K_p`, `K_i`, `K_d` are proportional, integral, derivative gains

**Physical Interpretation**: Maintains system stability and performance, based on classical control theory.

**Validation**:
- Step response analysis
- Overshoot < 10%
- Settling time within acceptable limits
- No sustained oscillations

### 5. Lyapunov Stability Analysis

**Mathematical Foundation**: Lyapunov's Second Method
```
V(x) = x^T P x  (quadratic Lyapunov function)
dV/dt = x^T (A^T P + P A) x  (Lyapunov equation)
```
Where:
- `V(x)` is Lyapunov function
- `P` is positive definite matrix
- `A` is system matrix

**Physical Interpretation**: Provides mathematical proof of system stability, based on nonlinear control theory.

**Validation**:
- P is positive definite
- dV/dt < 0 for all x ‚â† 0
- System eigenvalues have negative real parts

### 6. Quantum Information Theory

**Mathematical Foundation**: Quantum Fidelity and Entropy
```
F(œÅ‚ÇÅ, œÅ‚ÇÇ) = Tr[‚àö(‚àöœÅ‚ÇÅ œÅ‚ÇÇ ‚àöœÅ‚ÇÅ)]¬≤  (fidelity)
S(œÅ) = -Tr[œÅ log œÅ]  (von Neumann entropy)
```
Where:
- `œÅ` is density matrix
- `F` is fidelity measure
- `S` is entropy measure

**Physical Interpretation**: Quantifies quantum state preservation and entanglement, based on quantum information theory.

**Validation**:
- Fidelity = 1 for identical states
- Fidelity = 0 for orthogonal states
- Entropy = 0 for pure states
- Entropy = 1 for maximally mixed states

### 7. Statistical Mechanics

**Mathematical Foundation**: Boltzmann Distribution
```
P(E) = (1/Z) exp(-E/kT)  (Boltzmann distribution)
Z = Œ£·µ¢ exp(-E·µ¢/kT)  (partition function)
```
Where:
- `P(E)` is probability of energy E
- `Z` is partition function
- `k` is Boltzmann constant
- `T` is temperature

**Physical Interpretation**: Describes energy distribution in thermal equilibrium, based on statistical mechanics.
